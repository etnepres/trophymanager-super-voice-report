# Trophymanager SVR

Now with Super Voice Reports you can just relax and listen to your game reports.

This *userscript* uses external services with optional premium plans, if you like the service feel free to use premium but keep in mind **I get nothing for those purchases** and I dont control if the services fails in some way.

For now you can only choose one script:

[**natural_readers.user.js**](https://github.com/etnepres/trophymanager-super-voice-report/blob/master/natural_readers.user.js) uses [Natural Readers](https://www.naturalreaders.com/)

*Premium voices have as a total **20 minutes free per day**, that will most likely be **enough for a full match report**, just save your free minutes for the live matches.*
